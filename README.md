# Reaction paper to Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950)

The article mentions the Turing Test which is a test on whether machines have the capability to think like any humans. Alan Turing proposed a game called "Imitation Game", the goal here is that in order to know if a machine is capable of thinking is when it cannot tell apart whether the responses either came from a human or machine. It seems that Turing Test lacks some sort of self-awareness like any other humans and it is important to know that if a machine passes the Turing Test doesn't mean that it already has its own consciousness or insight. 

Currently, AI systems are able to analyze patterns in the language or data being fed to it and can produce responses related to it and limitations from these systems are evident such as the lack of complexity that a human mind has. Even if human experiences are being fed to it, it is still considered as data. The machine could probably only give answers based on the data it was given and the use of statistics. 

Alan Turing's approach only focuses on what machines can do. There are 4 objections mentioned in this article that caught my attention: theological, mathematical, and Lady Lovelace's objections. He had already anticipated that there are objections on the aspects such as mathematics, human consciousness, etc. and addressed these objections in a rather practical approach.

  The disability of machines if human intellect is not the subject is proved in Gödel's theorem from the mathematical objection. 
  
  Humans have souls thus it can be concluded that machines don't have souls — this is from a theological objection. 
  
  Machines are only programmed what to do — Lady Lovelace's objection. 
  
  Machines do not have subjective experience — from the consciousness objection.

Machines can learn through training to improve its capabilities and this is where the concept of machine learning comes in along with neural networks.
